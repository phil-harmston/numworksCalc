"""Statistics - is the science
of collecting, organizing,
summarizing, and analyzing
information to draw conclusions
or answer questions. In addition,
statistics is about the
providing a measure of
confidences in an conclusions.

population - is the entire group
to be studied

individual - is a person
or object that is a member
of the population being studied.

sample - is a subset
of the population that is being
studied.

statistic - is a numerical
summary of a sample.

Descriptive statistics - consist
of organizing and summarizing
data. Descriptive statistics
describe data through numerical
summaries,tables, and graphs.

Inferential statistics -
uses methods that take a result
from a sample, extend it to the
population, and measure the
reliability of the result

Parameter - is a numerical
summary of a population

Qualitative or categorical,
variables allow for
classification fo individuals
based on some attribute
or characteristic.

Quantitative variables -
provide numerical measures of
individuals. The values of a
quantitative variable can
be added or subtracted and
provided meaningful results.

Discrete variable -
is a quantitative variable that
has either a finite number of
possible values or countable
number of possible values.
The term countable means that
the values from counting, such
as 0,1,2,3, and so on.  A
discrete variable cannot
take on every possible value
between any two possible values.

Continuous variable - is a
quantitative variable
that has an infinite number
of possible values that are not
countable.  A continuous
variable may take on every
possiblevalue between any two
values.


nominal level of measurement -
If the values of the variable
name, label, or categorize.
In addition, the naming scheme
does not allow for the values
of the variable to be arranged
in a ranked or specific order.

Ordinal level of measurement -
if it has the properties of the
nominal level of measurement,
however, the naming scheme allows
for the values of the variable to
be arranged in a ranked or
specific order.

Interval level of measurements -
if it has the properties of the
ordinal level of measurement
and the different in the values
of the variable have meaning.
A value of zero does not mean
the absence of the quantity.
Arithmetic operations such as
addition and subtraction can
be performed on values of the
variable

ratio level of measurement - if
it has the properties of the
interval level of measurement
and the ratios of the values of
the variable have meaning.
A value of zero means the absence
of the quantity. Arithmetic
operations such as
multiplications and division
can be preformed on the
values of the variable.

Observational study - measures
the value of the response
variable without attempting
to influence the value of either
the response or explanatory
variables.  That is, in an
observational study, the
researcher observes the
behavior of the individuals
without trying to influence
the outcome of the study.

Designed experiment - If a
researcher randomly assigns
the individuals in a study to
groups, intentionally
manipulates the value of an
explanatory variable,
controls other explanatory
variables at fixed values,
and then records the value
of the response variable for
each individual.

Confounding - in a study occurs
when the effects of two or
more explanatory variables are
no separated. Therefore, any
relation that may exist
between an explanatory variable
and the response variable may
be due to some other variable
or variables not accounted for
in the study.

Lurking variable - is an
explanatory variable that
was not considered in a study,
but that affects thenvalue of
the response variable in the
study.  In addition, lurking
variables are typically related
to explanatory variables
considered in the study.

Confounding variable - is an
explanatory variable that
was considered in study whose
effect cannot be
distinguished from a second
explanatory variable in the
study.

Census - is a list of all
individuals in a population
along with certain
characteristics of each
individual

Random sampling - is the process
of using chance to select
individuals from a population
to be included in the sample.

simple random sample - a sample
size of n from a population
of size N is obtained through
simple random sampling.
If every possible sample of
size n has an equally likely
chance of occurring.  The
sample is then called a simple
random sample.

frequency distribution - lists
each category of data
and the number of occurrences
for each catagory of data

relative frequency is the
proportion (or percent)
of observations within a
catagory and is found using
the formula.

                      frequency
relative frequency = -----------
        sum of all frequencies

relative frequency distribution -
lists each category of data
together with the relative
frequency.

bar graph - is constructed by
labeling each category
of data on either the horizontal
or vertical axis and the
frequency or relative frequency
of the category on the other
axis.  Rectangle of equal
width are drawn for each
category.  The height of each
rectangle represents the
category's frequency or
relative frequency.

histogram - is constructed by
drawing rectangles each
rectangle is the frequency or
relative frequency of the
class.  The width of each
rectangle is the same and the
rectangles touch each other.
______________________________
Cross-sectional Studies -
specific point of time

Case-control Studies -
retrospective look back in time.

Cohort Studies - group of people
to study (cohort) The cohort
is then observed over a long
period of time.

______________________________

Arithmetic mean - of a
variable is
computed by adding all the
values
of the variable in the data
set and dividing by the
number of observations.  The
population arithmetic mean.
***u (mew) is computed using
all the individuals in a
population.  The population
mean is a parameter
                         _
Sample arithmetic mean - x (
x-bar)is computed using
sample data. the sample mean
is a statistic.

median - of a variable is the
value that lies in the middle of
data w;hen arranged in
ascending order. We use "M"
to represent median.

resistant - a numerical summary
of data is said to be
resistant if extreme
observations (very large or
small) relative to the data
do not affect its value
substantially.

mode - of a variable is the
most frequent observation of
the variable that occurs in
the data set.

Range - of a variable is the
difference between the
largest and the smallest data
value
largest data value
smallest data value
R = ldv - sdv

Population Standard deviation -
is the square root of the sum of
squared deviations about the
population mean divided by
the number of observations in the
population. N that is the
square root of the mean of
the squared deviations about
the population mean.
symbolically represented by
o (lowercase greek sigma)
